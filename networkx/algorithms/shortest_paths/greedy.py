    """Returns a list of nodes in a shortest path between source and target
    using the greedy-search algorithm.

    There may be more than one shortest path.  This returns only one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Starting node for path

    target : node
       Ending node for path

    heuristic : function
       A function to evaluate the estimate of the distance
       from the a node to the target.  The function takes
       two nodes arguments and must return a number.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNoPath
        If no path exists between source and target.
